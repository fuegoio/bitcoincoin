# BitCoinCoin

BitCoinCoin is a fake crypto-currency trading platform on which the rates of the crytpo-currencies are taken from the real world. You can buy and sell your favorite crypto-currencies directly on the platform and watch your value evolve with time, compare your score with every one and create or join banks together to merge efforts.

## Getting started

To launch the infrastructure needed (database), we use Docker and Docker-compose :

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Back-end

To setup the backend, we need first to create a virtualenv and install the requirements once :

```
$ cd back/
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The backend has two processes that can be run from the same codebase : the HTTP API and a Celery worker that is gonna process tasks in background.

#### API

The API can be launched with the `web.py` file :

```
$ cd back/
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python web.py
```

#### Worker

The Celery worker can be launched with the `tasks.py` file :

```
$ cd back/
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python tasks.py
```

This worker is also a Celery beat, which means that it will trigger actions defined by a schedule.
In our case, it is used to refresh the coins database.

### Front-end

To setup the front, we need first to install the requirements once:

```
$ cd front/
$ npm install
```

Then to launch it:

```
$ cd front/
$ npm run serve
```

### Pycharm configuration

In this project, Pycharm is already configured with the right database and the right run configurations: the backend and
the frontend ones.
